## These are a few things I use to manage my personal finances.
+ I completed my MBA with a portion of my student loan debt at a higher interest rate than I would have liked. Now there are a ton of student loan refinancing options out there and I recommend you do your own research. However, after a careful review of the LIBOR forecast and my expected tax exposure over the remainder of my anticipated pay back period, I decided that a variable rate refinance of a portion of my debt with [Earnest](https://www.earnest.com/invite/harley93) fit my situation the best.

+ If you're still undecided on a commission-free investing platform I would recommend [Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/harleyr33). In conjunction with some knowledge of python and their API it's possible to build out a functional commission-free trading model that's a fun way to earn a lunch or two every now and then. If you're interested in learning more about algorithmic trading I learned through [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/getting-started). While they no longer support broker integrations it's still a fantastic well knowledge to dip into if you're getting your feet wet or if you want to brush up on a few things.

+ Heralding back to my days as a broke graduate student [Acorns](https://acorns.com/invite/C4D9AQ) Round-Ups feature collects the loose change from in between the couch cushions and the pennies Iâ€™d get back from my morning coffee and instead of getting sticky in my car's cup holder they invest it into a portfolio with exposure to thousands of stocks and bonds. Also they cover any trading fees and they automatically reinvest dividends. I treat this as a holding pattern for money that can be invested without much thought or risk. When it makes sense I'll withdraw these funds (usually once a year) and reinvest it in my primary account.


If you or someone you know is looking to learn more about any of the topics my guests or I bring up there are plenty of fantastic titles available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/gift-membership-detail?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1524210806852&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=hrockhill3g0c-20&linkId=00c1f0b6b9dd29a8138ab3d56aa35031">Audible </a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hrockhill3g0c-20&l=pf4&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If you don't have an account already try out a gift membership for a month and listen to [You May Also Like: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice by Tom Vanderbilt](https://www.audible.com/pd/You-May-Also-Like-Audiobook/B01CROB488?pf_rd_p=6a5ce8e4-798e-4a64-8bc5-71dcf66d673f&pf_rd_r=SRBP2D4CY5F3FBAD21KD&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B01CROB488) which was a refreshing reprieve from marketing research papers and attempts to help us better understand how all of us perceive, judge, and appreciate the world around us. Or one of my favorites, [Pricing the Future by George Szpiro](https://www.audible.com/pd/Pricing-the-Future-Audiobook/B006FKAUB8?pf_rd_p=6a5ce8e4-798e-4a64-8bc5-71dcf66d673f&pf_rd_r=3YA2KCV5Y0HZ5EF8XX4Q&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B006FKAUB8) which tells the story of discovery of the Black-Scholes options pricing formula.
